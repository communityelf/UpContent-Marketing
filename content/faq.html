		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h3>What does UpContent do?</h3>


		<p>UpContent is a content discovery tool that helps you take immediate action on content you care about - not just monitoring brand mentions - to drive new, more meaningful conversations. UpContent’s unique algorithms help you find the content that matters, not just what’s viral, by the influencers that actually know your industry best. No more passive content curation that gets lost in the noise.
</p>

		<h3>How do I create a topic?</h3>


		<p>After the initial set-up process, you will automatically be directed to the query builder where you can develop a search query based on the results you wish (and don’t) wish to find.
</p>

		<p>To access the query builder after the initial set-up, click on the gear icon “Create New Topic” on the bottom-left of your screen.
</p>

		<p>For a video on how to use the query builder, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tTepI-nrrs">here</a>.
</p>

		<p>Type in the keywords and phrases that <strong>must</strong> be included in your results under the title, “Results must contain ALL of:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.</p>

		<p>Next, add additional keywords and phrases where at least one of them must appear in order for the article to be added to your topic under the second text box titled, “Results must contain ANY of:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.
</p>

		<p>Finally, add the keywords and phrases that, if appearing in an article, would exclude it from appearing in your results under the final text box titled, “Results must NOT contain:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.
</p>

		<p>If you prefer, you can build your own search query using Boolean operators, by clicking on the “Enter My Own Query” link.
</p>

		<p>After you are finished creating your topic, click “Generate Query” and then “I’m done.” Finally, give the topic a name and UpContent will begin scouring the web for your desired content.
</p>

		<h3>Why am I not getting the results I am looking for?</h3>


		<p>Query building is part art and science. To ensure you are receiving the articles that are most valuable, the first step is to understand where the problem may lie.
</p>

		<p><ol style="margin-left: 30px;">
      <li>Getting a lot of articles that are not relevant to what I am looking for - Review the criteria for your topic and consider adding additional required phrases that must be present in each article found (AND) or include phrases that, if present should exclude the article from the result set (NOT).</li>
      <li>Not seeing any results - This often occurs when you have too many required phrases in your topic (AND). We would recommend switching some of these to OR phrases to broaden the criteria and find a greater volume of results.</li>
</ol></p>

		<p>To implement changes in your topic, click the pencil or gear icon next to the topic name (will have to click the gear icon next to the UpContent logo and then Manage My Account first to reach this in the content source) to reach the query builder.
</p>

		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once clicking on the “I’m Done. Save Topic.” or “Save,” UpContent will automatically look for new articles that meet your criteria. It will also keep the results previously found for your topic. If you do not wish to have the previously found suggestions, click on the “duplicate topic” icon next to the topic name via the content source or create a new topic within the stream using your new criteria.
</p>

		<p>Too much, too fast? We’d love to personally assist you in building a custom search query. Please send us a message through our live chat feature or email us at <a href="mailto:info@upcontent.com">info@upcontent.com</a>.
</p>

		<h3>How do I read the full text of the article or blog post?
</h3>

		<p>Click on the card of the content you would like to read, and the full-text of the article will appear. Click the “Close Detailed View” link at the bottom-left of the full text to close the full text view.
</p>

		<h3>Why isn’t the full text appearing for some of my results?
</h3>

		<p>Some content providers make it more difficult for us to extract the content. One example is Forbes: when you click a link to Forbes from all search engines, you will often hit this page first: http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/. This is call an interstitial. The same thing happens to UpContent, so we are often unable to extract the content of the article from content on Forbes. To read this content, you can click on the “View Original Source” link at the bottom-right of the full text view to load this article in a new tab.
</p>

		<p>If you are a content provider, and content from your own site is not appearing in the full text view on UpContent, you should verify that your page has been developed with the proper semantic use of HTML and is optimized for major search engines like Google. Please contact us at info@upcontent.com with any questions.
</p>

		<h3>How can I save or favorite a result to read later?
</h3>

		<p>Click on the heart icon on the card of the content you would like to save. All of your saved articles or blog posts can be accessed under the “Saved” sorting option, which can be accessed by clicking on “Saved” next to Status on the top navigation bar.
</p>

		<h3>How do I share content on social media?
</h3>

		<p>You can share content on social media by clicking on the arrow button on the card of the content you wish to share. If this is your first time sharing, you will be required to authorize your Buffer account.  You can then share immediately to a social media platform or to add the post to your queue.
</p>

		<h3>How do the different sorting filters work?
</h3>

		<p>You can view your result set in different ways by applying a sorting filter. You can choose your sorting filter by clicking on the filter next to Sort on your top navigation bar.
</p>

		<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Displays results in order of most applicable based on the search phrase</p>
		<p><strong>Recency:</strong> Displays content in order of most recently published</p>
		<p><strong>Shareability:</strong> Displays content in order of how shareable it is likely to be, based on its use of power words and phrases</p>
		<p><strong>Influence:</strong> Displays content in order of the most influential sources based on the search phrase</p>


		<p>You can also view relevance and influence visually with our graph view. You can learn more about these graphs by watching these quick tutorial videos:

		<h3>What is shareability?</h3>


		<p>Shareability is a proprietary score that we assign content based on its propensity to be shared. We are continuously improving the weighting and factors that contribute to shareability scores, but some core factors include the presence or absence of an image on the page, and the presence of certain words in the title and body of the content that research has linked to higher clickthrough rates.
</p>

		<h3>What is influence?</h3>


		<p>Influence is a measure of an article’s ability to drive other content to reference it. We measure influence by creating a graph of all of the links in your result set. This produces a custom graph of content that is exclusive to your topic. The graph helps us determine which articles are at the center of a particular conversation, helping you find the original sources of a conversation.
</p>



		<h3>Where does UpContent get its content?</h3>


		<p>UpContent gets its content from millions of blog and news content providers across the internet using our own proprietary crawling and filtering algorithms. With this approach, the number of sources continues to grow - exponentially.
</p>

		<p>Not seeing a source you want? Let us know (info@upcontent.com). We’d love to add it!
</p>

		<h3>Why should I share someone else’s content?</h3>
