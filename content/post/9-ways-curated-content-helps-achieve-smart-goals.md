We’re big into curating content around these parts, in case you haven’t noticed. We believe in it so much that we built a tool to make it easier and more meaningful. Even though UpContent gives you everything you need to make discovering and curating a more efficient part of your workflow, there’s still an art behind deciding which pieces of content to curate and when.

Before you start sharing random content, it’s important to create an intentional content curation strategy that will help you establish goals that measure the success of your efforts. Remember, these goals should be S.M.A.R.T.: Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-Bound.

Here's a guide that can help you map out these goals:

Once you’ve settled on your goals, then you can apply that lens to your [discovery process](https://upcontent.com/post/how-to-evaluate-content/), focusing only on curating specific content that will help you achieve these goals.

### If your goal is to sell a new product or service/increase site traffic, you should curate:

1. **Content from thought leaders that address the problem(s) you are attempting to solve with your product/service.** Not only does this demonstrate that you are a go-to expert in the industry, but it also invites your audience into the “Awareness” stage of [the Buyer’s Journey](http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-new-buyers-journey).

2. **Original content that speaks to and explains your product/service.** Naturally, you will want to balance out your curated content with product-specific content that shows your audience how your product solves a problem they have. This also helps to move your audience into the second stage of the Buyer’s Journey, ”Consideration,” where they will begin to consider choosing your product or service over others.

3. **Word-of-mouth reviews and testimonials.** Don’t just let your audience take your word for it. Curate testimonials and reviews from current users and loyal influencers. Providing these mini case studies will move your audience in the final “Decision” stage of the Buyer’s Journey, hopefully leading to a purchase!

### If your goal is to gain impressions/clicks/reactions on social media, you should curate:

1. **Viral content that fits your messaging.** People love to react to content that everyone is talking about. Give them that opportunity by curating trending articles, videos, and pictures, but make sure this content falls under the overall tone and messaging of your brand. Otherwise, it will seem out-of-the-ordinary and clickbait-y.

2. **Interesting and unique content your audience cares about.** Staying on top of trends is important, but going above and beyond to find unique content that others haven’t shared is what will set you apart. This is where [UpContent](http://upcontent.com) comes into play. We’ll help you uncover the stuff your audience really cares about, written by the real experts in your niche, not just those who are popular. Remember, don’t just guess at what your audience cares about it; do some research first and interact with your followers before searching for this noteworthy content.

3. **Shareable media.** If the article or blog post includes videos, gifs, pictures, or a striking quote, it’s more likely to be shared. Boost the volume of this shareworthy content to see an increase in impressions and reactions.

### If your goal is to increase social media followers, you should curate:

1. **Industry influencer content.** Sharing content from industry experts not only provides value to your audience, but it helps to establish relationships with valued influencers. These influencers may return the favor and share your content with their audiences, enticing them to follow you as well. **Related:** [Everyone Has Influence: How to Stand Out in a Social Media World](https://upcontent.com/post/everyone-has-influence/)

2. **Original content that provides a unique angle.** With so much content out there these days, it can be tempting to just rephrase what the industry has already said. However, you should try your best to publish content that adds something new to the conversation. People will naturally gravitate toward content that provides a new perspective and stands out.

3. **Relevant content created by your audience.** It’s important to turn to your newsfeed and curate the content that is being created by your followers. Not only will this prompt your audience to take notice and likely share or respond to your content, but it will also begin forming strong, loyal connections formed on genuine appreciation.

Now that you have some basic formulas for curating by marketing goal, you can mix and match as you transition between goals and get to know your audience even better.  Be sure to track how well your curated content is performing to inform your future efforts.
