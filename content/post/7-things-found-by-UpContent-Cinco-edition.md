Last year, I threw my first annual Cinco De Mayo party. I was unemployed and had plenty of time to put together a party of epic proportions. We had tons of food, decorations, and, of course, a variety of mixed adult beverages to enjoy. It was also the first time I was able to use my “big” backyard (hey, I live in a city, ANY backyard is big) to its fullest capacity and invite people over to experience it. And experience it they did. If there was any indication of the good times had by everyone, it’s the fact that almost a year later I’m still finding faux mustaches stuck on various objects around my house.

This year is a little different. I’m working full time and didn’t think I would have the time to put together a party that was up to my standards. Fortunately, that’s [where UpContent came in](https://upcontent.com/post/more-efficient-content-curation/). Instead of spending multiple nights searching on Google, pinning on Pinterest, and crafting instead of resting or working, I plugged my queries into UpContent and found seven awesome links I would have never found on my own. While this year’s party may be on May 7th (because that pesky thing called work gets in the way of having a Thursday night party), with these finds it’s sure to be better than ever.

## The Food
The first three links UpContent showed me were all about food, and none of them were disappointing. I have a pretty good stash of recipes at my house, however it’s always good to change it up.
<ol>
<li>[10 dishes to rock your Cinco de Mayo celebration](http://www.philly.com/philly/food/257013171.html) - The pico de gallo recipe here is about to change my world. While it starts out simple enough, the addition of garlic salt is blowing my mind as it’s something I’ve never thought of.</li>

<li>[Habanero Salsa Recipes](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/habanero-salsa-recipes.html) - Speaking of mind blowing salsa, this mango habanero recipe might be the first recipe to make me feel confident enough to use this spicy pepper without it setting someone’s mouth on fire.</li>

<li>[27 Terrific Taco Recipes You Simply Must Try](http://communitytable.parade.com/493117/felicialim/27-terrific-taco-recipes-you-simply-must-try/) - I always try to do something different when I make shrimp tacos, and the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos with Cilantro-Lime Crema (number 5 of 27) look like exactly what I need.</li>
</ol>

## The Drinks
What’s a Siete De Mayo (get it?!) party without delicious beverages to share. While I’m partial to sangria, UpContent helped me find two margarita recipes that I might actually like!

<ol start="4">
<li><a href="http://www.cupcakesandcutlery.com/watermelon-margarita-recipe/">Watermelon Margarita Recipe</a> - Last year’s signature margarita was a strawberry basil concoction. This watermelon mint margarita might just give that one a run for its money. Plus, who doesn’t love watermelon?</li>

<li><a href="http://www.livinglocurto.com/2016/03/best-margarita-recipes/">The Best Margarita Recipes</a> -  The cherry limeade margarita recipe literally had me drooling at my desk. While I’m not sure if my 1980s style blender will last long enough to make enough margaritas for an entire party, I think this margarita would taste just as delicious unblended.</li>
</ol>

## The Party
While I love my backyard, putting up a little Mexican flair to celebrate the occasion is a must. While I was planning on grabbing some decorations in an after the 5th sale, I might just have to DIY some of the decor thanks to these UpContent discovered articles.

<ol start="6">
<li><a href="http://www.thesitsgirls.com/party/cinco-de-mayo-party-ideas/">Cinco De Mayo Party Ideas</a> - The sign that says “fiesta like there’s no manana” made me laugh harder than it probably should. Which is why I’m definitely making it for my party.</li>

</ol>

Thanks to UpContent, my 2016 Cinco (Siete) De Mayo party is sure to be a hit. I was able to discover a ton of new articles, recipes, and ideas that would have taken me ages to find on Google, Bing, or Pinterest. Now that everything’s been found and planned, it’s time to fiesta!
