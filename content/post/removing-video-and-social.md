As we near the release of our newest iteration on UpContent’s platform and feature set, you will notice a prominent omission from the content set – social media and video content.

The root of this decision traces back to the reason we entered into this voyage – to find the best content to enter into the conversations you want to have, faster.

We have spent much of 2015 listening and analyzing the behavior of our current customer base to better understand how UpContent can be valuable to them, both as a professional tool and a method for personal consumption.

## Removal of video and social suggestions a result of quantitative and qualitative findings

In speaking with current and potential customers, we generally received a great deal of interest when recounting [our mission to unearth the best blog and news content](http://www.upcontent.com/post/navigating-the-foundation-stage) within a specific topic. However, when discussing our ability to identify relevant video and social content, we were often met with a comparison to many of the excellent social listening or video search technologies that already existed.

When looking at the activity conducted by our customers since launch, a similar story emerged. Video and social content presented with a 30% higher bounce rate than news and blog content and drove less than 2.5% of all customer actions in the last 90 days. It was apparent that our first pass in these areas was measurably less successful than that in news and blogs.

## A reintroduction of image and video content forthcoming

In no way does this decision indicate a belief that these content types are not important to the conversation.  A picture remains “worth a thousand words,” and we intend to re-introduce this type of content to our technology in a way that lives up to our standards of discovery – the automation of those nuanced factors we all apply as human beings to evaluate the efficacy of content.

## Social content deemed to be part of a different conversation
In our evaluation, there are a myriad of successful social media listening technologies present in our industry, many of whom do an excellent job in the identification of current conversations occurring across all social channels. Further, it was decided by the team that the sourcing, monitoring, and evaluation of these conversations required a wholly different approach than the content that seeded them. For these reasons, it was determined that a furtherance of this effort would do more to diffuse, rather than strengthen, the value of UpContent to its customers.

I apologize for any complication this may cause, and look forward to UpContent continuing to be your “go-to” source for finding the best content to power your conversations. It is our hope that you will find that the upcoming features to be released in January, and related platform integrations, will exceed your expectations.
