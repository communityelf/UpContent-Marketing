UpContent and Content Gems each offer a similar service: they provide content to users who are looking for information or who need content to curate. But each company approaches the issue a little differently.

Both solutions focus on the marketer who needs the right content, at the right time to effectively interest and engage their audience.  They can also cater to the knowledge leader who needs an efficient way to stay up-to-date with their industry and have discussion topics readily available.

However, the way each tool seeks to solve these challenges is where they differ.  UpContent goes beyond the industry standard of filtering results by recency and relevance by layering on Shareability and Influence. These filters narrow down content to just what marketers and knowledge leaders want and need. The shareability filter scans the titles and content body of articles searching for specific psychological indicators that increase the propensity for a piece of content to be shared. The Influencer filter factors in multiple variables that determine how influential the author or outlet of the content piece is. The end result is that you find the content you want very, very quickly.

Content Gems filtering capabilities stop at popularity (and we are not sure what factors go into figuring out what is popular).

The content we find and serve will save you time, money and resources, and will help you power and lead the conversations that help you gain and retain customers.

What will work best for your company depends on your goals. If you are interested in a tool that will help you find the best content to power, guide, and lead conversations among your audience, please give UpContent a try.  We feel strongly that we have created a newer, better way to find content.  We look forward to your feedback.  


## Here are a few key points to compare:

### Content Sources
UpContent pulls content from the sources you are already manually reviewing when searching for content to share and curate. It crawls blogs, news sources, video sites, Twitter and Facebook.

Content Gems, according to their FAQ, pulls content from “blogs and news sources, consumer magazines, business publications, newswires, and more.”  Users can also manually enter RSS feeds and specific Twitter accounts they want to track (the number of Twitter accounts ranges from 1 to 10 depending on the package purchased).

### Date Range
UpContent allows you to search content from the last 24 hours, last 7 days, or last 30 days.
Content Gems allows you to search content from the last 24 hours or last 7 days

### Filtering
Content Gems filters by popularity or relevance within the timeframe of 24 hours or the last 7 days.
UpContent filters by timeframe and relevance, and shareability or influence.
As explained above, UpContent layers two unique filters for searching content, Shareability and Influence, on top of determining the relevance and recency of the content. Shareability predicts and finds the content that has the best chances of being shared by your audience, which is very valuable when driving customer engagement. Influence serves you content that was produced by thought-leaders and by the individuals/brands that people within an industry listen to. This is always great content to share and to consult when curating; plus, it could be a great way to discover new influencers within your industry to establish a relationship with.

### Hootsuite Application
Content Gems pulls you out of the Hootsuite tool to the web-based application to update filter settings. You then need to refresh the feed within Hootsuite for changes to take place.
UpContent allows you to make all filtering adjustments within the app.
