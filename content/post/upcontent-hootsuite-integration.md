We’re thrilled to announce the launch of UpContent within Hootsuite’s Content Sources! With this new integration, we help to address the soul-sucking challenge that marketers worldwide endure in their relentless [pursuit of engaging and relevant content](https://upcontent.com/post/5-reasons-you-need-content-curation/) to foster deeper relationships with their intended audience.  HOORAY!

At times like these it is important to take a step back and reflect on how we arrived at this point. Thinking back to [the genesis of UpContent](https://upcontent.com/post/navigating-the-foundation-stage/) in 2013 (which, at the time, wasn’t enough of a thought to even warrant a name) as a way to assist our account managers who provided social media engagement services and became frustrated at how much time it was taking to identify great, third party, content. This waste amounted to nearly 20% of each individual’s day--just looking for great information to share!

### The Real Problem with Content Discovery

Our small team took up the torch to “find a better way” and, through countless focus groups, conjoint surveys, user discussions, and expert interviews, came to the following core realizations about content discovery:

- **It needs to be active.** - Relying on the customer or the use of an unnamed expert in some distant land to find the best information for a variety of niche topics is fundamentally flawed with bias. This need was particularly acute for agency or professional services environments where there is the need to quickly develop a base of knowledge across multiple industries.
- **It needs to be dynamic.** - The [criteria for the “right content”](https://upcontent.com/post/how-to-evaluate-content/) to be used changes based upon the post’s intent and audience. For this reason, we needed to ensure that the content returned can be sorted by the main criterion used by marketing professionals: relevance, recency, shareability, and influence.
- **It needs to be comprehensive.** - Being yet another place to look for great content is of little value. We were in a game of “winner takes all” and needed to ensure that the technology would achieve a similar level of coverage to today’s leading search engines. Otherwise, the risk of change was too great and manual methods of search engine email digests, bookmarks, and manual lists of websites to check would reign forever!
- **It needs to be fast and easy.** - All things considered, the greatest benefit of something new is saving time. For that reason we needed to ensure that not only the act of identifying which content was best, but also the process of getting it posted to the appropriate platform was seamless.

### UpContent’s First Love - Hootsuite

In early 2015, we assessed the current ecosystem of marketing technologies and determined the most expedient path to understanding the greater value of UpContent was to become an engine for content discovery--rather than trying the be another full-service technology. We firmly believe that we should stick with what we’re good at and integrate UpContent with a larger, established, platform in which (1) our target customers already spent a large amount of their time, and (2) the issue of finding great content was most acute.
After evaluating a number of options, Hootsuite’s ecosystem, culture, and techology appeared to be a great fit. Working closely with the Hootsuite team, UpContent launched as a stream within the [Hootsuite](http://hootsuite.com) platform in March 2015.

### Our Work Was Far From Over

The ability to share something we built with “the world” for the first time was an experience I will never forget. We immediately saw traction in individuals utilizing UpContent but, more importantly, we were welcomed with a fair amount of immediate, and actionable, customer feedback.

While it seemed that the content being found was valuable, the ability to effectively translate what an individual was looking for into an appropriately crafted topic was a challenge for many. Further, in order for a customer to read an article, they were required to click on the link for an article and wait for it to open in a new tab. It was clear we needed to further reduce the time this task took.

To address these challenges, we gave UpContent its own home at my.upcontent.com in June 2015. This launch allowed our customers to minimize scrolling when reviewing results and view the full text of the content--minimizing time wasted switching tabs or waiting for pages to load.

The user experience was fully redesigned in January 2016 to provide a more pleasing experience and, with it, brought the ability to visualize recency and influence as well as the creation of user profiles and [shareable links to exchange topics between users](https://upcontent.com/post/sharing-topics-strategy/), or place in your favorite RSS reader.

### With Product/Market Fit, Time to Let People Know We Exist

Throughout this period of rapid iteration, we elected to invest capital in honing the technology rather than marketing its benefits. Yes, we are a marketing company and whether this was the best course of action is surely debatable, but the team shared a vision and wanted to ensure we had something that consistently and reliably addressed the core use problem.

After the January 2016 launch, there was certainly still work to be done, but the customer feedback was positive, prompting us to move into the next stage in the technology’s commercialization: repackaging ourselves as the engine to be inserted within a larger content marketing context.

### UpContent as the Sole Content Discovery Technology in “Content Sources”

In early 2016, we were made aware of an initiative within Hootsuite called “Content Sources.” The objective of this feature was to reduce the frustration experienced by Hootsuite users in bringing visuals and third party content into the Hootsuite platform for sharing across their connected profiles. It was hypothesized that by making it easier to share great content, the customer would be apt to share more and spend more of their time within Hootsuite--thus providing a greater opportunity to experience all the many other features Hootsuite can offer.

We jumped on this opportunity as it aligned almost entirely with our own hypothesis: UpContent is best served as an engine to deliver great content in an easy-to-navigate-and-consume manner, especially when it is integrated with a multitude of technologies where this content can be leveraged.

The product of this UpContent/Hootsuite joint-initiative brings the most valuable features of my.UpContent into the Hootsuite platform, including:

- **Topic Builder** - Not a fan of Boolean syntax? No problem. Our Topic Builder will walk you through the process to help ensure you are seeing the content that is most impactful for your needs.
- **Tile View** - See an array of articles including associated image, headline, and text snippet to quickly assess which content may be best for your intended purposes,
Full Text Extraction - View the full text of the article without the need to wait for another page to load or leaving the Hootsuite platform.
- **Topic Sharing and RSS** - Love your topic? Others will too! Use the link generator to create publicly sharable links to your topic and an RSS feed.
Stream to Source Interaction - The option to [utilize UpContent as a stream](http://appdirectory.hootsuite.com/185/upcontent) will continue to be available to our customers, and will serve as the hub for topic creation and management, within the Hootsuite platform.

We are overjoyed to share the fruit of our labors with you and look forward to receiving your feedback. It has been a pleasure to work through this initiative with the Hootsuite team and we are excited to see what the future holds between these two technologies.
