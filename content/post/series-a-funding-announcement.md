It is with great excitement that we share some news. UpContent has closed our Series A round of funding, led by [Topanga Partners](http://topangafund.com/), a private equity fund based in Pittsburgh. Through these efforts, we raised $2 million (USD) to accelerate growth and gain invaluable resources to support our team.

Topanga Partners invests in early and mid-stage technology companies focused on product technology, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and digital platforms. This independent firm is an ideal fit for UpContent, as they bring a great deal of vital experience to the table and can also provide an objective view of our progress to-date. We are particularly excited to access the individuals on the Topanga team who have expertise in the growth and development of early stage technology and digital marketing companies.

So what does this mean for you, our users? We’re thrilled to share that with this funding, we can more rapidly progress the release of the features and functionality you have been asking for and apply additional resources and support to help ensure that you are finding the content that matters most. Here’s just a sample of improvements and features we hope to tackle in the coming year:

- Embeddable topic galleries for your website ([just released!](upcontent.com/gallery))
- Team collaboration features
- Faster initial result population
- Easier topic creation
- Expanding coverage of search results
- Improvements and new additions to the sorting and filtering options
- Content scoring based on your personal preferences
- Content scoring based on articles that have resonated with your audience

And these are just a snapshot of what’s to come! It’s going to be a busy year but also a very exciting one.

As we are currently only a team of six, we hope that this investment will allow us to grow, adding specialists who share our vision to consistently provide you with the best, most relevant content so that you can have more meaningful conversations with your audiences.

Thank you for using UpContent, providing feedback, asking questions, reading our blog, subscribing to our newsletter, and engaging with us on social media. We’re excited to share this next chapter of our journey with you!
