<p><strong>What does UpContent do?</strong></p>

<p>UpContent is a content discovery tool that helps users find more meaningful, interesting content so they can spend less time searching and more time engaging in conversations with their audience.</p>

<p><i>How do I create a topic from Hootsuite Content Source (especially this one)</i></p>

<p><strong>Why am I not getting the results I am looking for?</strong></p>

<p>We recommend taking a moment to evaluate your current search query. Click on the gear icon next to the topic name on the left-hand navigation of your screen. Use the query builder tool to ensure that you have included and excluded the proper keywords and phrases. </p>

<p>If you have made some tweaks and are still experiencing an inconsistency in results, we’d personally love to assist you in building a custom search query. Please send us a message through our live chat feature or email us at <a href="mailto:info@upcontent.com">info@upcontent.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How do I read the full text of the article or blog post?</strong></p>

<p>Click on the card of the content you would like to expand and the full-text of the article will appear. Click the x to return to your suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Why isn’t the full text appearing for some of my results?</strong></p>

<p>Some content providers make it more difficult for us to extract the content. One example is Forbes: when you click a link to Forbes in Google, you will often hit this page first: http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/. The same thing happens to UpContent, so we are often unable to extract the content of the article from content on Forbes.</p>

<p>If you are a content provider and content from your own site is not appearing in the full text view on UpContent, you should verify that your page has been developed with the proper semantic use of HTML and is optimized for major search engines like Google.</p>

<p><strong>How can I save or favorite a result to read later?</strong></p>

<p>Click on the star icon on the card of the content you would like to save. All of your saved articles or blog posts can be accessed under the “Saved” sorting option, which can be accessed by selecting Saved Suggestions from the last drop-down menu on the top navigation bar.</p>

<p><strong>How do I share content on social media?</strong></p>

<p>You can share content on social media by clicking on the arrow button on the card of the content you wish to share. The Hootsuite compose box will appear with the title and URL of the content. You can edit the content and save or send now to add to your queue.</p>

<p><strong>How do the different sorting filters work?</strong></p>

<p>You can view your result set in different ways by applying a sorting filter. You can choose your sorting filter by clicking on the desired filter on your top navigation bar.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Displays results in order of most applicable based on the search phrase</p>
<p><strong>Recency:</strong> Displays content in order of most recently published</p>
<p><strong>Shareability:</strong> Displays content in order of how shareable it is likely to be, based on its use of power words and phrases</p>
<p><strong>Influence:</strong> Displays content in order of the most influential sources based on the search phrase</p>

<p><strong>What is shareability?</strong></p>

<p>Shareability is a proprietary score that we assign content based on its propensity to be shared. We are continuously improving the weighting and factors that contribute to shareability scores, but some factors that we can share are the presence or absence of an image on the page, and the presence of certain words in the title that research has linked to higher clickthrough rates.</p>

<p><strong>What is influence?</strong></p>

<p>Influence is a measure of an article’s ability to drive other content to reference it. We measure influence by creating a graph of all of the links in your result set. This produces a custom graph of content that is exclusive to your topic. The graph helps us determine which articles are at the center of a particular conversation, helping you find the original sources of a conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Where does UpContent get its content?</strong></p>

<p>UpContent gets its content from millions of blog and news content providers across the internet. We use Google’s search APIs to sift through hundreds of millions of articles and ensure that our results are relevant to the queries in your topic.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I share someone else’s content?</strong></p>

<p>There are a variety of goals you can achieve through curating outside content. A successful curation strategy can help you:
<ul>
	<li>Create opportunities to start conversations on topics you care and are knowledgeable about</li>
	<li>Become a go-to expert in your niche</li>
	<li>Build trust through the consistent posting of high-quality content</li>
	<li>Establish relationships with other top influencers whose content you are sharing</li>
	<li>Support and complement your own created content with related articles or blog posts</li>
	<li>Maintain an active presence on social media to stay top-of-mind</li>
	<li>Learn what your audience likes and wants to see more of to shape your future content </li>
</ul>
