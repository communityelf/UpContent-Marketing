You acknowledge that UpContent has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Site, Services or UpContent Content or to review or edit any User Content, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Site and Services, to ensure your compliance with these Terms of Use, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body. UpContent reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any UpContent Content and any User Content, that UpContent, in its sole discretion, considers to be in violation of these Terms of Use or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>

<p>Without limiting other remedies, UpContent may at any time suspend, terminate, or refuse to provide you with access to the Site or Services. In addition, UpContent may notify authorities or take any actions it deems appropriate, without notice to you, if UpContent suspects or determines, in its own discretion, that you may have or there is a significant risk that you have (i) failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Use or any policies or rules established by UpContent; or (ii) engaged in actions relating to or in the course of using the Site or Services that may be illegal or cause liability, harm, embarrassment, harassment, abuse or disruption for you, UpContent users, UpContent or any other third parties or the Site or Services.</p>

<p>Without limiting any other terms of these Terms of Use, you may stop using the Site and Services at any time.
After any termination, you understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation to provide the Site or Services and all licenses and other rights granted to you by these Terms of Use will immediately cease.

UPON ANY TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION, ANY CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING USER CONTENT) THAT YOU HAVE SUBMITTED ON THE SITE OR VIA THE SERVICES WILL NO LONGER BE ACCESSIBLE BY YOU VIA THE SERVICES THEREAFTER.</p>

<p>Any suspension, termination or cancellation will not affect your obligations to UpContent under these Terms of Use (including, without limitation, proprietary rights and ownership, indemnification and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination or cancellation.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>

<p>THE SITE, SERVICES, UPCONTENT CONTENT, THIRD PARTY MATERIALS AND USER CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UPCONTENT EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON- INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. CONTENTGEMS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SITE, SERVICES, UPCONTENT CONTENT, THIRD PARTY MATERIALS OR USER CONTENT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS.</p>

<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM CONTENTGEMS OR THROUGH THE SITE, SERVICES, UPCONTENT CONTENT OR USER CONTENT, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.</p>

<h2>Indemnity</h2>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold ContentGems, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with User Content, your access to or use of the Site, Services or ContentGems Content, or your violation of these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</p>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT THEREIN REMAINS WITH YOU. NEITHER CONTENTGEMS NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENTGEMS CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL.</p>

<p>SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT THEREIN, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT UPCONTENT HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UPCONTENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</p>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL UPCONTENT’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT THEREIN EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN CONTENTGEMS AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>

<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between ContentGems and you regarding the Site, Services and ContentGems Content, and these Terms of Use supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between ContentGems and you regarding the Site, Services and ContentGems Content.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without UpContent’s prior written consent.

For notices made by Email, the date of transmission will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>The failure of UpContent to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of UpContent. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Use invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. There are no third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use unless provided expressly by this agreement.</p>
