  <h2>How to Get the Most From UpContent</h2>
  <p>The power of UpContent is its ability to help you find the right content to power conversations and spark engagement among your audience.  To help ensure the suggestions you receive are most aligned with the conversations you seek, here are a few tricks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Question:</strong> How do I create a topic?
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Answer:</strong> When you create a topic, UpContent will provide you with a single line for a keyword.  Once you begin typing on that line, another line for another keyword will appear. What you put in a single line vs. what you enter on a separate line is interpreted differently. The logic used by UpContent in developing a topic is a blend of Pandora® and your favorite search engine. This nuance is subtle, but can be powerful in fine-tuning your topic to receive the best suggestions.</p>
          <p>Using Multiple Lines: When creating a Pandora® station, you are able to add variety by including multiple artists, genres, or specific songs to a single station.  This allows you to enjoy many kinds of music (similar or dissimilar) at the same time. UpContent’s separate search term lines employ the same logic. By entering search phrases on multiple lines, you are telling UpContent to look for each of these phrases individually, then blend them together based on your filter choices. </p>
          <p>Creating Search Terms: UpContent treats each search term (the words entered on a single line) in a similar fashion to your favorite search engine. Due to this treatment, you can use quotation marks (“”) and standard Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine how you would like the search phrase on each line interpreted. A few pointers:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Spaces/AND. Spaces are automatically interpreted as AND.  An example would be if the search term was Community Elf, the only suggestions returned would be those with both the word community and the word elf somewhere in the suggestion. 
            <li>OR. Using OR as part of your search term will only provide suggestions for one of the two terms on either side of it. For example, the search term Community OR Elf will show suggestions where the word community appears, but elf does not – and vice versa. Using this term will also provide suggestions where both words appear.  For this reason, the more words included in a single search term (row), the larger the suggestion set, but also the more narrow the suggestions that achieve the greatest relevance.</li>
            <li>NOT. Using NOT will exclude suggestions containing a certain word or phrase.  For example, Community NOT Elf will return a subset of all suggestions that have the word community by excluding those that also have the word elf. </li>
            <li>Quotes. When looking for specific phrases (e.g. Community Elf), be sure to include quotation marks (e.g. “Community Elf”) or your search term will be subject to the Spaces treatment outlined above.  NOTE: The use of quotes is not currently active for the Blog type within UpContent. It will be available in a future release.  </li>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Question:</strong>   Why aren't suggestions appearing immediately after creating a topic?
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Answer:</strong>  Unlike a traditional search engine, UpContent was designed to scour the web to identify the right content to power conversations and spark engagement.  It takes approximately 1-3 minutes to provide suggestions, which largely depends on the volume of suggestions available for your topic across each of the sources.  We recommend navigating to another task for a minute or two while your initial suggestions load, or switching between "Types" using the filter icon (suggestionss may load faster for some sources).  If you still do not see suggestions, please contact us at <a class="basic" href="mailto:info@upcontent.com">info@upcontent.com</a> and we will resolve it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Limited suggestions returned. 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Depending on the topic, it may not lend well to certain source types. If you do not receive many suggestions for a specific content type, try the other sources using the Filter tool.  In many cases, a topic may have poor suggestions in one source (e.g. Social Media), but show exactly the conversations you wish to participate in another (e.g. Blogs or News).</li>
        <li><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Commonly, few suggestions are returned because a topic may be too specific – it may contain too many keywords/phrases or overly narrow phrases. To broaden your search, try removing some of the phrases that are more granular (<a class="basic" href="/howitworks/howtouse/">Editing and Changing Topic</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <em style="padding-left: 80px;">Note: When you edit a topic, the new topic criteria are saved for the next refresh (2x daily) of content. If you wish to see suggestions for the newly created topic immediately, please create a new topic with the criteria.  </em>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Irrelevant suggestions returned – an area of continuous improvement for the UpContent team. In some cases, the initial set of suggestions shown do not appear to have much to do with the topic you created, or there are several irrelevant suggestions scattered amongst the suggestions list.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong>  A great hack to this issue is to change how the content is being sorted. For the best suggestions, have the content sorted by Influence or Shareability, UpContent’s two unique, advanced filtering options. This will allow you to view a different perspective of the suggestions and may surface more of the content that meets your needs.  Also, be sure to switch between sources using the Type filter, as some topics may have more valid suggestions in one medium vs. another.</p>
        <p>To change how the content is sorted, navigate to the Filter menu by clicking on the Filter icon, then modify the Sort option to Influence or Shareability. </p>
