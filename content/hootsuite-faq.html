<h3>What does UpContent do?</h3>


<p>UpContent is a content discovery tool that helps you take immediate action on content you care about - not just monitoring brand mentions - to drive new, more meaningful conversations. UpContent’s unique algorithms help you find the content that matters, not just what’s viral, by the influencers that actually know your industry best. No more passive content curation that gets lost in the noise.
</p>

<h3>How do I create a topic from the UpContent Hootsuite Stream?</h3>


<p>Click the gear icon to the right of your current topic. Click “Add New Topic.” Then, give your new topic a name and type in your desired search phrases. As you type your first phrase, a new box will appear below it, should you wish to include another phrase.
</p>

<p>Each new box will <strong>expand</strong> the number of articles that fit your criteria, so it is important for the phrases in each box to be as specific as possible. For example, if the phrase in the first box is “Pittsburgh” AND “Real Estate” and the phrase in the second box is “Commercial development”, your topic will provide all articles within the last 30 days that include the phrases Pittsburgh and “Real Estate” <strong>AND</strong> any articles that include “Commercial development”. On the contrary, if you only want articles on Pittsburgh commercial development in real estate. Your first phrase should be “Pittsburgh” AND “real estate” AND “commercial development”, with no second phrase.
</p>

<p>You can click on the “x” next to any search box to delete it. Once you have included all desired phrases, click “Create.”

<h3>How do I create a topic from Hootsuite Content Source?</h3>


<p>After the initial set-up process, you will automatically be directed to the query builder where you can develop a search query based on the results you wish (and don’t) wish to find.
</p>

<p>To access the query builder after the initial set-up, click on the gear icon next to the UpContent logo at the top-left of the content source. Then click the “Manage Your Account” button. Then the “Create Topic” button to the right of the screen.
</p>

<p>For a video on how to use the query builder, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tTepI-nrrs">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Type in the keywords and phrases that must be included in your results under the title, “Results must contain ALL of:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.
Next, add additional keywords and phrases where at least one of them must appear in order for the article to be added to your topic under the second text box titled, “Results must contain ANY of:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.
</p>

<p>Finally, add the keywords and phrases that, if appearing in an article, would exclude it from appearing in your results under the final text box titled, “Results must NOT contain:”. After each word or phrase, hit the enter key. You will see the word or phrase appear below the text box and the query will begin to form at the top of the screen.
</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can build your own search query using Boolean operators, by clicking on the “Enter My Own Query” link.
</p>

<p>After you are finished creating your topic, click “Generate Query” and then “I’m done.” Finally, give the topic a name and UpContent will begin scouring the web for your desired content.
</p>

<p>To create additional topics, click the gear icon next to the UpContent logo on the top navigation bar. Click on “Manage Your Account.” Next, click “Create a topic” to add an additional topic using the workflow above.
</p>

<h3>Why am I not getting the results I am looking for?</h3>


<p>Query building is part art and science. To ensure you are receiving the articles that are most valuable, the first step is to understand where the problem may lie.
</p>

<p>Getting a lot of articles that are not relevant to what I am looking for - Review the criteria for your topic and consider adding additional required phrases that must be present in each article found (AND) or include phrases that, if present should exclude the article from the result set (NOT).
Not seeing any results - This often occurs when you have too many required phrases in your topic (AND). We would recommend switching some of these to OR phrases to broaden the criteria and find a greater volume of results.
</p>

<p>To implement changes in your topic, click the pencil or gear icon next to the topic name (will have to click the gear icon next to the UpContent logo and then Manage My Account first to reach this in the content source) to reach the query builder.
</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once clicking on the “I’m Done. Save Topic.” or “Save”, UpContent will automatically look for new articles that meet your criteria. It will also keep the results previously found for your topic. If you do not wish to have the previously found suggestions, click on the “duplicate topic” icon next to the topic name via the content source or create a new topic within the stream using your new criteria.
Too much, too fast? We’d love to personally assist you in building a custom search query. Please send us a message through our live chat feature or email us at info@upcontent.com.
</p>

<h3>How do I read the full text of the article or blog post?</h3>


<p>Click on the card of the content you would like to read, and the full-text of the article will appear (content source), or a new tab will load showing the article (stream). Click the x, or close the new tab, to return to your suggestions.
</p>

<h3>Why isn’t the full text appearing for some of my results?</h3>


<p>Some content providers make it more difficult for us to extract the content. One example is Forbes: when you click a link to Forbes from all search engines, you will often hit this page first: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/</a>. This is call an interstitial. The same thing happens to UpContent, so we are often unable to extract the content of the article from content on Forbes. To read this content, you can click on the “View Original Source” button below the image to load this article in a new tab.
</p>

<p>If you are a content provider, and content from your own site is not appearing in the full text view on UpContent, you should verify that your page has been developed with the proper semantic use of HTML and is optimized for major search engines like Google. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@upcontent.com">info@upcontent.com</a> with any questions.
</p>

<h3>How can I favorite a result to read later?</h3>


<p>Click on the star icon on the card of the content you would like to save. All of your saved articles or blog posts can be accessed under the “Favorite Content” filter option within the Status drop-down at the top navigation bar on the content source .
</p>

<h3>How do I share content on social media?</h3>


<p>You can share content on social media by clicking on the arrow button on the card of the content you wish to share. The Hootsuite compose box will appear with the title and URL of the content. You can edit the post and share immediately, save, or schedule for a later date.
</p>

<h3>How do the different sorting filters work?</h3>


<p>You can view your result set in different ways by applying a sorting filter. You can choose your sorting filter by clicking on the desired filter on your top navigation bar.
</p>

<p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Displays results in order of most applicable based on the topic criteria. </p>
<p><strong>Recency:</strong> Displays content in order of most recently published.</p>
<p><strong>Shareability:</strong> Displays content in order of how shareable it is likely to be, based on its use of power words and phrases></p>
<p><strong>Influence:</strong> Displays content in order of the most influential sources based on the search phrase</p>


<h3>What is shareability?</h3>


<p>Shareability is a proprietary score that we assign content based on its propensity to be shared. We are continuously improving the weighting and factors that contribute to shareability scores, but some core factors include the presence or absence of an image on the page, and the presence of certain words in the title and body of the content that research has linked to higher clickthrough rates.
</p>

<h3>What is influence?</h3>


<p>Influence is a measure of an article’s ability to drive other content to reference it. We measure influence by creating a graph of all of the links in your result set. This produces a custom graph of content that is exclusive to your topic. The graph helps us determine which articles are at the center of a particular conversation, helping you find the original sources of a conversation.
</p>

<h3>What are the “tags” within the UpContent content source for Hootsuite?</h3>
<p>Up to three tags may appear at the bottom of each suggestion card within the UpContent content source. These tags indicate core themes of the article that are shared among a subset of content within your topic. By clicking on a tag, you are able to filter the articles displayed to only include those that cover that theme.
</p>

<p>A breadcrumb will also appear at the top left of the content source showing the current tag applied.
</p>

<p>To see all content once a tag is applied, click on the topic name to the left of the tag in order to remove this filter.
</p>

<h3>Where does UpContent get its content?</h3>


<p>UpContent gets its content from millions of blog and news content providers across the internet using our own proprietary crawling and filtering algorithms. With this approach, the number of sources continues to grow - exponentially.
</p>

<p>Not seeing a source you want? Let us know (<a href="mailto:info@upcontent.com">info@upcontent.com</a>). We’d love to add it!
</p>

<h3>Why should I share someone else’s content?</h3>
